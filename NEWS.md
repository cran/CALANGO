# CALANGO 1.0.8

- Regular maintenance update:

    - Minor internal changes to ensure compatibility with dendextend v1.15.2.
    - Changed naming standard of report plots to increase Windows compatibility:
      file names of correlation plots and boxplots now use "_" rather than ":".

# CALANGO 1.0.5

- Regular maintenance update:

    - Tested compatibility with taxize v1.0: OK
    - Added function *retrieve_calanguize_genomes()* to enable users to quickly 
    retrieve the *calanguize_genomes* Perl script, which is useful for preparing 
    data to be used with CALANGO
    - Removed input attribute `url` from function *retrieve_data_files()*. This 
    does not break existing code - if `url` is passed it will just be ignored.
    - Updated package logo in all documentation.
